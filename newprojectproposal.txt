1.We are going to create a Jabber instant messaging service on one of our instances. We will test it by checking if the authorized members are able to log in and instantly chat amongst each other.
2. The user population would be only us and other people we add to the authorization key document for the instance.
3. There shouldnâ€™t be too many security issues as long as the Jabber instance requires key authentication and has no password so no one can brute force hack it.
4.Downloading and installing the jabber package, possibly making a puppet module for the the jabber instance. Maintaining the instance would involved updating the jabber package with apt-get and adding member to the authorization key file so more people can log onto the server and chat.
5.Administratively we would have to manually add a member to our authorization key text as  well as making sure members are connecting to the right port. Users will need a key pair from amazon to be able to be authorized to log onto the server.
