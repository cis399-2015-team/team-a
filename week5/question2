The results of our load balancer when we shutdown one of our instances is that the displayed number of healthy host in the
monitoring tab, dropped to 1. The displayed numebr of unhealthy hosts increased as well.
When attempting to view the webpage located at the balancer's DNS, it was able to display correctly, our web page on our instance.

When we shut down both of our instances the monitor tab in the EC2 console correctly showed the number of healthy and unhealthy
hosts, and it also displayed some back-end server errors as well. When trying to access the webpage through the balancer's
DNS the page displayed was blank, with no description as to why no page was displayed.

After shutting down both, the restoring both, the balancer correctly displays the proper page and the monitoring tab 
shows accurate information as to the number of healthy and unhealthy instances.
