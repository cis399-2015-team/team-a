To find the public ip of a given instance in the ec2 console you can do the following:

When you first log in to the AWS page you will see the "Compute" section on the home page of the console.

Under that section click the EC2 virtual servers, link.

There is a navigation bar on the left and on that bar click the "Instances" link which shows the current running instances.
The page should now display a big list of running ec2 instances. 

Now, click on one of the instances(there are small boxes to click on that highlight blue when selected)
and in the section below the list of instances, information about the currently selected one will be dislpayed.

There are a few tabs to look at including: "Description", "Status Checks", "Monitoring", and "Tags".
Select the "Description" tab and 2 columns of information about your instance will appear. On the right column, there is
a label for "Public IP:" and this is shows the public ip of the instance.
